# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines the content refurbishment strategy for clarifying LEAAS's positioning as a "Launch Engine as a Service" - a startup launch partner and plug-and-play product + engineering team. The approach focuses on communicating the unique value proposition as a "mini incubator without equity" while maintaining the existing UI components, layouts, and visual design system.

## Architecture

The design maintains the current Next.js application structure with no architectural changes required:

- **Frontend**: Existing React components and pages remain unchanged
- **Styling**: Current Tailwind CSS classes and design system preserved
- **Components**: All existing UI components (cards, buttons, forms) maintained
- **Layout**: Current responsive grid systems and page structures kept intact

## Components and Interfaces

### Homepage Content Updates

**Hero Section (app/page.tsx)**
- Maintain existing hero layout and animations
- Keep "LAUNCH ENGINE AS A SERVICE" headline as it perfectly captures the brand
- Update subtitle to emphasize "plug-and-play product + engineering team for founders" and "turn ideas into products fast"
- Update CTA buttons to "Get Free Launch Consultation" and "Launch Your Idea"

**What We Do Section**
- Preserve current 4-card grid layout with icons
- Update service descriptions to reflect core LEAAS services:
  - MVP Development: "Turn your idea into a working minimum viable product"
  - Product Design: "UI/UX, branding, and launch-ready design"
  - Launch Support: "Pitch decks, landing pages, and go-to-market guidance"
  - Ongoing Development: "Fractional tech team for growth and iteration"

**Why Choose Us Section**
- Maintain existing layout with image and feature list
- Update feature descriptions to emphasize startup launch benefits:
  - "Plug-and-Play Team" instead of "Team of Mentors"
  - "Build and Launch in Weeks" instead of "Hands-on Learning"
  - "No Hiring Hassle" instead of "End-to-End Guidance"

**Testimonials Section**
- Keep existing card layout and star ratings
- Update testimonial content to reflect founder success stories and startup launches
- Focus on outcomes like "launched in weeks," "got funding," "validated idea"
- Maintain avatar images and attribution structure

### Pricing Page Redesign (app/packages/page.tsx)

**Service Categories Structure**
Replace the current 4-package grid with 3 service categories:

```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ MVP Development │   Mobile Apps   │ Custom Software │
│ Starting $900   │ Starting $1500  │ Starting $2000  │
│                 │                 │                 │
│ • Web Apps      │ • Native iOS    │ • SaaS Platforms│
│ • Landing Pages │ • Android       │ • Internal Tools│
│ • MVP Launch    │ • Cross-platform│ • Custom Logic  │

│[Launch Consult] │[Launch Consult] │[Launch Consult] │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```
